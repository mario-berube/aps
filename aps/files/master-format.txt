## Master file format version 1.0           2001.08.21 CCT&NRV

IVS Master File Format Definition
=================================
Master files are used by the IVS community to record the VLBI sessions
observed. There is one master file for each year, beginning with 1979,
for the 24-hour sessions. The 1-hour intensive sessions are included
in the master files for 24-hour sessions through 1991. From 1992
onward, the 1-hour sessions are included in a separate file.

Links to all the master files can be found at
http://ivscc.gsfc.nasa.gov/service/master.html.

Master file names are of the form masterxx.txt or masterxx-int.txt, 
where "xx" is the 2-digit year.

     masterxx.txt      Master files for 24-hr sessions, 1992-present,
                       and for 24-hr plus Intensive sessions, 1979-1991
     masterxx-int.txt  Master files for Intensive sessions, 1992-present

This file defines the format of each session line. The master files 
have one line per observing session. The field descriptions and
codes, except for station codes, are in this file. Station codes 
are in the file ns-codes.txt. Other codes are in this file in 
sections that begin with "xxx CODES" alone on a line, followed 
by the code lines, terminated with a line that has "end xxx CODES".
Each code line has the code field followed by the explanation
on the rest of the line.

Each session line begins with a "|" character. Non-session lines 
may begin with any character except "|". The first and last lines 
of the master file begin with a "#" character and identify the 
format version number. 

The session lines in the master file have fields which are delimited
by the "|" (vertical bar) character. Each field consists of alphanumeric
characters with no embedded spaces. 

There may be leading or trailing blanks in a field and these should 
be ignored. Fields are not restricted to a particular width nor to
particular columns on the line. The line should be parsed using the 
"|" character as delimiter and removing trailing and leading blanks.

Fields that are mandatory to be filled in are those with headings: 
SESSION, CODE, DATE, DOY, STATION, SKED, CORR, DBC, SUBM. All of these 
fields are currently filled in. Other fields may be blank, please look
below for more details.

Fields are defined by number, that is, the order in which they appear 
on the session line.  If new fields are added at the end of a session 
line, this should not cause software reading the master files to fail. 
There are currently 13 fields and two proposed fields for a total of 15. 


Field    Title     Format
1        SESSION  The name of the session. This 10-character
         NAME     field is generally an expansion of the code
                  found in field 2. The name is normally used 
                  visually to aid readers in recognition 
                  of the session. Names are unique throughout the
                  master files, i.e. every session from 1979 onward 
                  has a unique name. 

2        SESSION  The official 6-character code name for the 
         CODE     session. The code is assigned by the Coordinating 
                  Center. Codes generally consist of 2 or 3 letters,
                  indicating the type of session, followed by a
                  number, indicating the sequence of this session
                  in the series. Codes are unique throughout all the
                  master files, i.e. every session from 1979 onward 
                  has a unique code. 

3        DATE     The start date of the session. Date format is mondd, 
                  where mon is the first three letters of the month
                  name, and dd is the day of the month. The year of
                  the session may be seen in the title line of the
                  file, or obtained from the file name (see above
                  for definition of file name format.)

4        DOY      The day of year corresponding to the date of 
                  the session.

5        TIME     The start time of the session in Universal Time,
                  in the format hh:mm. This field will be blank until
                  1993.

6        DUR      The approximate duration of the session in hours.
                  This field may be blank until 1993.

7        STATIONS The stations in this session. Each station is
                  represented by its 2-letter code. Refer to the
                  file ns-codes.txt for the full station name. The
                  order of station codes in this list is arbitrary.
                  Station codes are listed in a single long string,
                  with no separation character. A station is not
                  removed from this list if it was scheduled to
                  participate in the session but did not participate
                  for some reason. Non-participating stations are 
                  placed in a second field that begins with "-". 
                  Example:
                        GcKkWzMcWfTc     original network
                        GcMcWfTc -KkWz   actual network

8        SKED     The 4-character code for the IVS Operation Center
                  or other agency responsible for making the schedule 
                  file for this session.

11       PF       The processing factor for the session. Processing factor
                  is a measure of the efficiency of the correlator. This 
                  field may be blank up to 2001.
                  PF = (number of correlator hours)/(duration of session)

12       DBC      The 2-letter data base code for the X-band data base. 
         CODE     The S-band data base has the same code except that the
                  first letter is "S". The data base code is assigned by the 
                  Coordinating Center. Some of the codes have been used 
                  once or for tests and can be reused. If you need a new
                  code please contact C. Thomas to find a code that can

14      DEL       The time delay between data recording and availability for 
                  analysis, in days. This is a measure of the efficiency 
                  of the shipping and correlation processes. Time delay is 
                  calculated as the time from the end of the observing session 
                  to release of the data base by the correlator. This is the 
                  number of days that it took to ship tapes, correlate, 
                  re-process, and submit the version 1 data base for the 
                  session. The number in the time delay column will be negative 
                  until the observation is completed, and then it will 
                  continue to increase until the session is released.
                  This field will be blank until 2002.

15      MK4       The session number assigned at the Mk4 correlators. This 
        NUM       is the number used by the Mk4 correlators to reference a 
                  particular session. Use of this number will help everyone 
                  when discussing a session with correlator personnel.
                  This field will be blank for non-Mk4 correlators starting
                  in 2002.
